# Pixelflut
Fast pixelflut server written in C. It is a collaborative coding game. See https://cccgoe.de/wiki/Pixelflut for details about the game itself. In short: project the pixelflut server output onto a wall where many people can see it. Connected clients can then set single pixels by sending a string like "CC [x] [y] [color]\n" (e.g. "CC 100 300 00FF12\n") to its TCP socket. Use netcat, python or whatever you want.

## Hardware requirements
Every x86 dual-core with a little bit of graphics power (for 2D SDL) should work. On an Core i3-4010U you can easily utilize a 1 GBit Nic. On large events, 10 GBit fiber and a few more CPU-Cores are even more fun. On real server hardware you want to add a graphics card. One thread per CPU-Core seems to be a good rule of thumb.

## Features
- Multithreaded
- Can display an overlay with some statistics
- Serves real-time WebGL histogram and help text to browsers (same TCP port)
- Optional fade to black for old pixels to encourage pixel refreshes
- Supported commands:
  - send pixel: 'CC {x} {y} {GG or RRGGBB or RRGGBBAA as HEX}\n'
  - set offset for future pixels: 'OFFSET {x} {y}\n'
  - request output resolution: 'SIZE\n'
  - request client connection count: 'CONNECTIONS\n'
  - request help message with all commands: 'HELP\n'

## Build
On a clean Debian installation with the "SSH server" and "standard system utilities" selected during setup:
```
apt update
apt install xorg git build-essential pkg-config libsdl2-dev -y
git clone https://github.com/larsmm/pixelflut.git
cd pixelflut
make
./pixelflut --help
```

## Connection limit
Best practise: set overall limit of the pixelflut-server high (--connections_max 1000) and limit max connections to the pixelflut port (default: 1234) per IP via iptables to 10-20:
```
nano iptables.save
```
paste (set limit in --connlimit-above):
```
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD ACCEPT [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1234 --tcp-flags FIN,SYN,RST,ACK SYN -m connlimit --connlimit-above 20 --connlimit-mask 32 --connlimit-saddr -j REJECT
COMMIT
```
Ctrl+x, y, return to save.
Activate:
```
iptables-restore < iptables.save
```

## Start Server
start x server first, then the pixelflut server:
```
startx &  # start in background
./pixelflut
```

## Stop Server
Press q or Ctrl+c

## Multiple screens
If you need the output to be displayed on a second screen (projector), you have to tell it which display to use, e.g.:
```
DISPLAY=:0.1 ./pixelflut
```
- If you expand the main display, the main display will be ":0.0" or ":0" and the projector ":0.1".
- If you duplicate the main display, the main display will be ":0.0" and the projector ":1.0".
- If you have only one display, it will be ":0.0" or ":0".

## Display driver
Sometimes the free NVidia driver has problems on multiple displays. So install the proprietary driver:
1. detect the chip and find the right driver:
```
nano /etc/sources/sources.list
```
Add: "contrib non-free" after each source
```
apt install nvidia-detect
nvidia-detect
```
2. install driver:
```
apt install for example: nvidia-legacy-340xx-driver
reboot
```
3. configure your displays:
```
startx
```
run the following inside the x-session and setup your displays:
```
nvidia-settings
```
or via SSH:
```
DISPLAY=:0 nvidia-settings
```
maybe restart x server

## Prevent standby
If you are using a notebook and want to close the lit. To disable all standby stuff:
```
systemctl mask sleep.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

## TODO
- Use epoll() to check multiple sockets for I/O events at once
- better network-statistics
